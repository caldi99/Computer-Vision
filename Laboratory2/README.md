# Computer-Vision
Repository for computer vision stuff


This directory contains several directories each one of them represent the tasks to carry out for each laboratory.
Inside those directories, you will find several others named as "task".
If you want to compile and execute the code found inside each one of the directories called "task" you need to :
 - go inside one of those directories
 - create a folder called build (mkdir build)
 - move inside such folder (cd build)
 - execute the following two commands : "cmake .." and "cmake --build ."
 - finally execute the code by using the following command "./TaskX" where X is the number of the task carried out
